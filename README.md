Task:
Develop a Responsive Dashboard Using React.js
Objective:
Create a user-friendly, responsive dashboard interface as part of our ongoing project.
Task Details:
1 Dashboard Layout:
◦ Design and implement a dashboard layout with a sidebar, header, and main content area.
◦ The sidebar should include navigation links, while the header should display the user profile and notifications.
2 Data Display:
◦ Integrate a chart library (like Chart.js or Recharts) to display key metrics in the main content area.
◦ Add a table that lists data fetched from an API (you can use a mock API like
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

3 Component Structure:
◦ Break down the UI into reusable components (e.g., Sidebar, Header, DashboardCard, Chart, DataTable).
◦ Use prop drilling or Context API to manage component interactions.
4 Responsive Design:
◦ Ensure the dashboard is fully responsive across all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
◦ Use CSS modules or styled-components for consistent and maintainable styling.
5 State Management:
◦ Utilize React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) for managing local state.
◦ Implement global state management if necessary, using Context API or a state management library like Redux.
6 Form Handling:
◦ Add a simple form for users to filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., date range, category).
◦ Implement form validation using a library like Formik or React Hook Form.
